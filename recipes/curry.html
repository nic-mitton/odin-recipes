            <li>1½ tbsp neutral oil (for cooking)</li>
            <li>salt (to taste)</li>
            <li>pepper (to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Curry Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>7 oz. Japanese Curry Roux (often sold in 3.5oz boxes)</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ketchup</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For Serving</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Prep</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice onion into wedges.  </li>
            <li>Peel carrots and cut <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGAFGMkIQmE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rangiri style.</a></li>
            <li>Peel potatoes and cut into cubes. Soak potatoes in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.</li>
            <li>Peel and grate Ginger. Mince Garlic</li>
            <li>Peel and core apple. Grate the apple and set aside.</li>
            <li>Trim fat from chicken thighs. Cut into bite-size pieces and season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cook the Curry</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1½ tbsp neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat and add onions.</li>
            <li>Sauté onions, stirring occasionally, until translucent and tender. Roughly 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add Garlic and Ginger</li>
            <li>Add Chicken, cook until outside is no longer pink.</li>
            <li>Add carrots and stir to mix.</li>
            <li>Add 4 cups water.</li>
            <li>Heat until nearly boiling. Skim scum and foam from surface. Repeat skimming as needed over next few steps.</li>
            <li>Add grated apple, honey, and a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Broth should be barely covering ingredients. Adjust liquid if necessary.</li>
            <li>Allow to simmer uncovered for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add potatoes. Allow to simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat. Separate curry roux into individual pieces and place in a medium mixing bowl</li>
            <li>Use a ladle to pour broth over curry roux. Try to avoid including meat/vegetables with broth.</li>
            <li>Use a utensil (I recommend a potato masher) to dissolve curry roux into broth. Once fully dissolved, pour contents of mixing bowl back into pot.</li>
            <li>Add ketchup and soy sauce.</li>
            <li>Simmer about 5 minutes to allow curry to thicken, stirring often. If curry is too thick, water can be added to thin it.</li>
            <li>Serve curry with freshly steamed japanese short-grain rice.</li>
        </ol>
